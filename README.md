Generate API KEY and replace it in Constants.java

To fetch popular movies, you will use the API from themoviedb.org.
If you donâ€™t already have an account, you will need to create one in order to request an API Key.
In your request for a key, state that your usage will be for educational/non-commercial use. You will also need to provide some personal information to complete the request. Once you submit your request, you should receive your key via email shortly after.
